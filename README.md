Working on this assignment was really fun for myself. I enjoyed making this and I actually got to implement a little potion function which slightly changed the gameplay. 

Some things to possibly add in the future:
- [ ] Add a fancy "Goblin Slayer fan game" title somewhere
- [ ] Style the buttons/log container
- [ ] Add sounds on attack or potion use
- [ ] Implement a run away function
